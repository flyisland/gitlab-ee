# The only feature-level coverage of Duo Agentic Chat, and deliberately the only
# place it lives.
#
# Everything observable in jsdom is covered by the MSW integration tests in
# ee/spec/frontend/msw_integration/duo_agentic_chat/: message streaming, the
# session ID dropdown, cancel and retry, tool-call rendering, the tool approval
# card, agent and model selection, and additional context injection. Those drive
# the stream explicitly rather than racing it.
#
# What is left needs a browser and a real duo-workflow-service:
#
# - the round trip from the websocket through duo-workflow-service and the GitLab
#   API to the database, which no amount of frontend mocking can prove
# - the buttons on other pages that open the panel with a canned prompt, which
#   only exist in those pages' markup
#
# The page-entry examples used to be shared examples included into the issue, job
# and blob specs. That spread duo-workflow-service across five files and filed
# the resulting flakiness against whichever page spec included them, because
# flaky-test issues are attributed per file path. Keeping them here is what makes
# that attribution honest.
#
# Add agentic chat coverage here, or preferably under
# ee/spec/frontend/msw_integration/duo_agentic_chat/. Do not reach for a shared
# example: that is how this grew across five files the first time. See
# https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/work_items/603605.
