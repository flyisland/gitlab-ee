# Generates the fixtures consumed by the `fromHaml` adapter specs in
# ee/spec/frontend/vulnerabilities/components/vulnerability_details_enrichment/adapters.
#
# The fixture is the output of `VulnerabilitiesHelper#vulnerability_details_app_data`
# - i.e. the `data-*` payload mounted on the vulnerability details page - so the
# adapter is built against the actual output rather than a
# manual mock. When the helper or its serializers change, regenerating
# the fixtures (`rake frontend:fixtures`) reveals any impact on the adapter.
#
# The setup only populates the fields the adapter currently maps; it grows
# alongside the page (and the query) as more UI is built.
