    # Shared behaviour for replicators backed by Upload or upload partition
    # models (e.g. Geo::AbuseReportUpload, Geo::ProjectUpload).
    #
    # Implements BlobReplicatorStrategy's abstract carrierwave_uploader (every
    # Upload-backed model resolves it the same way), plus two overrides:
    #
    # 1. Model-ownership validation: Upload models carry a polymorphic `model`
    #    association. If the owning record has been deleted, attempting to build
    #    file paths raises an opaque exception. `predownload_validation_failure`
    #    and `calculate_checksum` intercept that case early and surface a clear
    #    error message.
    #
    # 2. Parent-checksum adoption: Upload partition models share a row in
    #    Geo::UploadState with their parent Upload. When the parent has already
    #    been verified, the first verification on each site returns the stored
    #    checksum instead of re-reading and re-hashing the file, avoiding
    #    redundant I/O when a partition replicator FF is first enabled.
    #    Reverification always reads the file.
    #
    # 3. Skip-download gating: on a secondary, a new registry skips the
    #    download only if the checksum will not be adopted, or if the legacy
    #    registry already verified this site's copy.
