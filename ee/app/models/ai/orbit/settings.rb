# frozen_string_literal: true

# Single entry point for all Orbit enablement gates.
#
# Encapsulates:
#   * platform-availability feature flags (`knowledge_graph`, `orbit_foundational_agent`)
#   * the per-user opt-in feature flag (`orbit_user_preference`)
#   * the user preference killswitch + four granular subsettings
#
# Callers should never reach into these flags or the user preference
# directly: go through this module so that any future change to the
# gating logic only has to be made in one place.
#
# Reference pattern: Search::Zoekt (ee/app/models/search/zoekt.rb).
