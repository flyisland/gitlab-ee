    # Some work item types (currently Epic) only support status behind a feature
    # flag. This module centralizes the base_type => flag mapping so every layer
    # that must honor it (widget exposure, lifecycle resolution, the type
    # projection, and the validation layer) asks the same question and stays
    # consistent across flag on/off.
    #
    # Status is scoped to the root ancestor, so the flags are always evaluated on
    # the root namespace.

      # Base types whose status support is still behind a feature flag. Types not
      # listed here (issue, task) are never flag-gated and are always enabled.
      # The per-type flag is evaluated in `status_enabled_for_base_type?` with a
      # literal flag name (required by the Gitlab/FeatureFlagKeyDynamic cop so
      # flag usage stays statically greppable).
