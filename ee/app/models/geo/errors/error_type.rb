    # This is the single source of truth for error metadata. The Geo cleanup tools
    # (Geo::Tools) use it to detect and resolve known errors, and it is intended to back
    # the Geo Troubleshooting Dashboard metadata work in gitlab-org/gitlab#548532 (the
    # typed Geo::Errors::* classes would link to an entry here via their identifier).
    #
    # Built on the Fixed Items Model because this is static, version-controlled data.
    # The known-errors docs reference is generated from these entries, see the planned
    # `rake geo:tools:compile_docs` / `geo:tools:check_docs` tasks.
