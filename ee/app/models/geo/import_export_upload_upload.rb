# Read-only model for the import_export_upload_uploads upload partition table.
#
# Upload partition tables are populated automatically by PostgreSQL's
# list partitioning on model_type. The application writes through the
# Upload model to the uploads parent table, and PostgreSQL routes the
# row to the correct partition.
#
# This model reads from the partition table for Geo replication. It
# inherits from Upload to get all Upload behavior (retrieve_uploader,
# model polymorphic association, absolute_path, etc.).
#
# Dual-path architecture:
#
# - Upload includes Geo::ReplicableModel, so after_create_commit fires
#   geo_create_event! via Geo::UploadReplicator for all upload types.
# - This model also includes Geo::ReplicableModel, but since records are
#   never "created" via this model, callbacks don't fire.
# - The save_partition_verification_details callback in EE::Upload
#   correctly writes verification state to the partition state table.
# - Geo events flow through UploadReplicator for all uploads (including this one),
#   while ImportExportUploadUploadReplicator handles replication on the secondary.
#
# The composite primary key (id, model_type) is overridden to just `id`
# since `id` is globally unique across all partitions (shared sequence).
