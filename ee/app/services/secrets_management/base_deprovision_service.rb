module SecretsManagement
  # Shared async-deprovision logic for both project and group secrets
  # managers. This is what the worker calls.
  #
  # The OpenBao paths we need to tear down (organization, root namespace,
  # the entity itself) are read off the maintenance task, NOT off the
  # secrets manager record. That's deliberate: by the time this runs, the
  # parent project or group may already be destroyed. The maintenance
  # task carries a snapshot of the IDs we need, taken at the moment the
  # destroy/transfer hook fired, so paths stay correct regardless of
  # what's happened to the live records in between.
  #
  # The SM row is typically already gone by the time this worker runs.
  # Either `InitiateDeprovisionService` destroyed it inline before
  # enqueuing this job, or the parent project/group was destroyed and
  # CASCADE deleted it. The maintenance task carries the snapshot ids
  # the worker needs; the orphan signal lives in the task table now,
  # not on the SM row. Stuck tasks (exhausted `MAX_RETRIES`) get picked
  # up by the reaper cron (gitlab-org/gitlab#600120).
  #
  # End state when everything succeeds:
  #   - OpenBao namespaces removed (entity -> root group -> org)
  #   - Secrets manager row destroyed
  #   - Maintenance task destroyed
  #
  # Subclasses (project / group versions) must implement:
  #   - lease_key_prefix     scope-specific lease key namespace
  #   - entity_path          the level-3 path (project_<id> or group_<id>)
  #   - find_secrets_manager best-effort lookup; may return nil
  #   - payload_key          key for the ServiceResponse payload

    # speculatively tries to delete them and tolerates two outcomes:
    #
    #   - "containing child namespaces": at least one sibling SM is
    #     still alive under this parent, so we leave the cleanup for
    #     whichever sibling runs last.
    #
    #   - "route entry not found": another worker beat us to the
    #     delete. Concretely, picture a group transfer that initiates
    #     deprovision for N SMs at once. Worker A finishes its entity
    #     teardown first, finds the parent empty, deletes it. Worker B
    #     finishes its entity teardown a moment later, also tries to
    #     delete the parent, but OpenBao reports the namespace is gone
    #     because A already deleted it. From B's point of view that is
    #     not an error: the desired end state is "parent removed", and
    #     it already happened.
