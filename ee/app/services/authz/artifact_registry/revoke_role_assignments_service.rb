    # A revocation names an assignee and a resource, no role: IAM stores one
    # ASSIGNMENT per (subject, object), so the pair identifies the assignment
    # and revoking removes whatever role the assignee holds there. Deleting an
    # assignment that does not exist succeeds for a subject IAM has already
    # seen, but IAM fails the whole batch with NOT_FOUND when any subject was
    # never granted anything. Both the single and bulk revoke mutations use
    # this service; the single revoke passes a one-element array.
