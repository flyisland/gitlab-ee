    # resolution strategy.

    # Dry run by default (the rake task only acts when DRY_RUN=false). The same flag gates
    # the destructive strategies (remove_duplicate_registries, delete_orphaned_uploads); the
    # count and sample shown by the caller are the operator's safety check before a real
    # run. The actual detection and mutation live in the per-strategy Geo::Tools::Resolutions
    # object; this service just orchestrates the site guard and the dry-run gate.
    #
    # Expects a single KnownError instance: it reads the count and then applies through the
    # same object, so that instance's memoized count and resolution stay in step.
