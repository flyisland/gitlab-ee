module Security
  # Enforces organization-level quotas on tracked security contexts during the
  # Vulnerabilities Across Contexts (VAC) closed beta rollout.
  #
  # The quota limit is stored on the organization (see
  # Organizations::OrganizationSetting#security_tracked_context_quota_with_default,
  # introduced in !233389). Enforcement is gated by the
  # :security_tracked_context_quota_enforcement feature flag so it can be
  # toggled independently of VAC tracking.
  #
  # NOTE: Security::ProjectTrackedContext lives on the `sec` database while
  # Organizations::Organization lives on `main`, so we cannot join across
  # databases. Usage is counted by scoping tracked contexts to the
  # organization's root namespaces via the denormalized `traversal_ids` column
  # (traversal_ids[1] is the root namespace id). This is acceptable for closed
  # beta; for GA scale we plan to add a dedicated `organization_id` column to
  # `security_project_tracked_contexts` (see #602171).

    # enforcement in an emergency without turning off VAC.
    #
    # The actor follows the rollout granularity. During the closed-beta rollout
    # callers (e.g. the tracked-context validation) pass the `project`, so
    # enforcement can be enabled per project. Later we can pass the
    # `organization` to toggle enforcement per organization without any change
