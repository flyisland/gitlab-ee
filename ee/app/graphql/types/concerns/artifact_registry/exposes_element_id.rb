module ArtifactRegistry
  # Exposes an Artifact Registry element's own identifier. Every element type needs one and
  # none can use `BaseObject#id`, so the field and its resolver method live here rather than
  # once per type. The caller passes the noun and the milestone it ships in, both of which reach
  # the public schema:
  #
  #   exposes_element_id noun: 'image', milestone: '19.4'
