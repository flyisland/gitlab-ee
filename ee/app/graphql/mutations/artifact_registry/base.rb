module Mutations
  module ArtifactRegistry
    # Foundation for the Artifact Registry repository mutations. It resolves the
    # organization from the request context, gates on the feature flag and the
    # organization's Artifact Registry read ability, acquires the request-memoized
    # client, and maps service errors through RendersErrors. Concrete mutations
    # implement #resolve_artifact_registry and return their payload fields; this
    # class supplies the standard `errors` array, so a mutation cannot ship an
    # ungated write or leak a client error by forgetting to wrap the call.
    #
    # Artifact Registry performs every per-operation authorization check, so the
    # Rails gate here is a membership floor (read ability), not a per-operation
    # pre-check; concrete mutations declare their own granular-token skip.
