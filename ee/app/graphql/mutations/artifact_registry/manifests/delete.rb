          "its records, permanently removing the manifest on a hosted repository, evicting the cached copy " \
          "on a remote one, or passing the request through on a virtual one. Deleting a manifest removes " \
          "tags pointing at it and index entries where it is the parent, though a manifest it indexed " \
          "survives untagged. Artifact Registry accepts rather than completes the request, so this reports " \
          "acceptance. Re-read the image's manifests afterward for the result. Deletion is refused if " \
          "another manifest indexes the target as a child, and the error lists at most " \
