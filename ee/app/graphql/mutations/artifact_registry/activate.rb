    # Provisions an organization's registry: the mutation the owner's setup page
    # calls. Extends the Artifact Registry mutation base, overriding its
    # membership floor with update_organization because only an owner may claim a
    # slug; the base supplies the flag gate, the organization, the error mapping,
    # and the standard errors array.
    #
    # Arguments are the organization and the requested slug only. The billing
    # anchor is derived server-side from the organization's top-level group, so a
    # permanent value never reaches a form field or a mutation argument.
    #
    # A slug refusal and the zero-or-several-top-level-groups refusal are
    # expected recoverable outcomes, so they populate the payload's errors rather
    # than raising.
