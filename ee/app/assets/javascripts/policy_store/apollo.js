// A denied read is null, which mergeObjects would also let replace the other
// query's write, so a page whose policies read succeeded would show a
// permission error. The experiment flag is read per request, so the two reads
// of one page load can disagree. Keeping the existing object means rows a
// revoke should hide stay until the page reloads; that is the cheaper failure.
