# Security::RelatedPipelinesFinder
#
# This finder returns the IDs of latest completed pipelines per given
# sources matching the SHA as the given pipeline. If the pipeline is a
# merged_request_pipeline, the source SHA of the pipeline is used to
# find the related pipelines.

# Arguments:
#   pipeline - pipeline for which the related pipelines should be returned
#   params:
#     sources:     Array<String>
#     ref:         String
