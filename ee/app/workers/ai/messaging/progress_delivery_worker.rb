    # Delivers live progress for a messaging-triggered workflow (e.g. Slack) to

    # collapses into one delivery and a quiet workflow does zero work.

    # The dedup config is load-bearing:
    #   - including_scheduled: true -- REQUIRED, else scheduled (perform_in) jobs
    #     are not deduplicated and every checkpoint would deliver.
    #   - if_deduplicated: :reschedule_once -- a checkpoint arriving mid-delivery
    #     is not dropped; it reschedules once so the trailing frame still ships.
