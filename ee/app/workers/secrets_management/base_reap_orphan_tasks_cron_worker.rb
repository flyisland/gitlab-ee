  # Safety-net cron that terminates `*SecretsManagerMaintenanceTask` rows the
  # normal retry cron has given up on. See gitlab-org/gitlab#600120.
  #
  # A task whose `retry_count` has reached `BaseMaintenanceTasksCronWorker::MAX_RETRIES`
  # is excluded from the retry cron's `retryable(MAX_RETRIES)` scope and
  # sits forever. The unique index on `parent_id` means a stuck task also
  # blocks the user from initiating a fresh provision or deprovision for
  # the same parent. The reaper is the post-incident reconciler that
  # unblocks the parent by terminating the stuck row.
  #
  # Terminate = call the same `DeprovisionService` the worker pipeline uses,
  # regardless of the row's `action`. The service tears down whatever
  # OpenBao state exists at the snapshot paths (idempotent, tolerates
  # "route entry not found" and "containing child namespaces"), deletes
  # the SM row if it still exists, and deletes the maintenance task.
  # After this pass the parent has no SM and no task; the user can
  # re-initialize cleanly.
  #
  # The reaper is deliberately blunt: it does not try to distinguish
  # transient outages from permanent failures, nor preserve partially
  # provisioned OpenBao state. Three retries by the retry cron over
  # ~15 minutes are the "is it transient?" gate; anything past that is
  # treated as stuck and cleaned up.
  #
  # Subclasses must implement `maintenance_task_class` and
  # `deprovision_service_class`.
