  # Provisions a group's secrets manager via a maintenance task. Replaces
  # the legacy `ProvisionGroupSecretsManagerWorker` (which takes
  # `(user_id, sm_id)` directly). Going through a maintenance task gives
  # the worker the same crash-recovery story the deprovision flow has
  # had from day one: if this worker dies, the task is left stale and
  # `GroupSecretsManagerMaintenanceTasksCronWorker` retries it.

    # The maintenance task is the single source of truth for retries: it
    # tracks `retry_count` and gets re-enqueued by the cron worker after
    # `STALE_THRESHOLD` up to `MAX_RETRIES`. Sidekiq's own retries would
    # run on a parallel clock and not touch `retry_count`, which would
    # let the cron's cap be silently exceeded.
