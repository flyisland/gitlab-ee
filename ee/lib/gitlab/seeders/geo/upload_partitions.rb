      # Seeds one real Upload into each partition of the partitioned `uploads`
      # table, so Geo replication/verification of the per-partition upload
      # replicators (epic https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/work_items/20933)
      # can be exercised on GDK and on a production-like environment such as staging-ref.
      #
      # Dependency-free by design: no FactoryBot. Each Upload row is created as
      # a side effect of assigning a file to a model's real CarrierWave mount
      # and saving it. PostgreSQL routes the row to the correct partition by
      # `model_type` (= model.class.base_class.name), and Upload#ensure_sharding_key
      # copies the sharding key from the parent. The three import/export holders
      # have no belongs_to that sets project_id in memory, so we set it explicitly.
      #
      # Records are created off an existing project (reused, not created) to keep
      # the parent chains shallow and to avoid polluting the environment with new
      # organizations. Leaf records created here are tagged with SEED_MARKER so
      # they can be found and cleaned up later.
