      #   entries the deltas already carry. We keep only the entries it adds (see
      #   #unseen_entries), which is what the compaction-triggering step wrote.
      # - A dict snapshot is the full replacement the gateway writes for a `plan` step edit
      #   or a `last_human_input` key-set change. Keeping it would re-record the whole
      #   channel per edit, so the trace reports appends only.
      # - A scalar (status, goal) has no delta form -- the gateway writes every value as a
      #   full replacement -- so each blob is a real transition, bar one that repeats the
      #   value before it, which is a group re-seed rather than a change.
