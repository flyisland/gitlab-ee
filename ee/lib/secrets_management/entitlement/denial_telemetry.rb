    # line) whenever Secrets Manager access is denied by entitlement state.
    # One firing point shared by every denial entry point: the GraphQL write
    # concern, the CI runner payload gate and the service-layer entitlement
    # gate. Policy conditions deliberately do not emit: they are pure
    # predicates re-run on speculative `can?` checks and type authorization,
    # which would pollute the metric with non-actions.

    # `mode` is always `enforce`: observe mode (would-deny telemetry without
    # enforcement) was deliberately skipped; the property is kept so
    # dashboards need no schema change if it lands later.
