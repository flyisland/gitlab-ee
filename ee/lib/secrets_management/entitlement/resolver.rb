    # - gitlab.com + online-cloud-licensed self-managed
    #   -> online branch. Authoritative source is CDot; the local
    #   `AddOnPurchase` mirror only carries quantity and does not surface
    #   trial / on-demand / grace state. Stubbed to `:ineligible` until the
    #   SubscriptionPortal client lands.
    #
    # - offline-cloud-licensed self-managed (air-gapped)
    #   -> local `GitlabSubscriptions::AddOnPurchase` mirror. No CDot
    #   connectivity means trial / on-demand / grace are unreachable;
    #   the only states observable here are `:offline_paid` and
    #   `:blocked + :subscription_grace_period_expired`.
    #
    # `Gitlab.com?` is OR'd alongside `online_cloud_license?` defensively:
    # staging / dev environments simulating gitlab.com may ship with a
    # non-online-cloud license shape, and we want them routed to the online
    # branch rather than silently falling through to offline.
