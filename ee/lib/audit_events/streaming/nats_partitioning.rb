module AuditEvents
  module Streaming
    # Shared partitioning scheme for the NATS audit event streaming pipeline.
    #
    # Subjects are partitioned into a fixed number of partitions rather than
    # one subject per group. There are millions of top-level groups, far beyond
    # what a single JetStream stream can track as distinct subjects (subject
    # state is held in memory), so a fixed partition count keeps subject
    # cardinality constant regardless of group count.
    #
    # Partition selection is random, not derived from the group ID. Deriving it
    # from the group ID (group_id % PARTITION_COUNT) spread group IDs evenly but
    # not volume: audit traffic is heavily skewed toward a few large namespaces,
    # so their partitions reached millions of pending messages while a single
    # drainer per partition capped throughput, leaving most of the fleet idle
    # (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/604456). Spreading each
    # event to a random partition evens out volume and lets many drainers work
    # a hot tenant in parallel.
    #
    # This drops per-group FIFO ordering: a group's events now scatter across
    # partitions and can be delivered out of order. That is acceptable because
    # the legacy per-event Sidekiq path (AuditEvents::AuditEventStreamingWorker)
    # never guaranteed ordering either, and receivers deduplicate on the stable
    # event ID.
    #
    # PARTITION_COUNT bounds consumer parallelism: each partition is drained by
    # one worker at a time. Publishing reads the count through
    # publish_partition_count so a later change can separate the publish and
    # drain counts (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/622750).
    #
    # Cells: subjects are not qualified by cell or environment. If the
    # JetStream cluster is ever shared across cells, group IDs are not unique
    # across cells and subjects would collide. Isolation therefore relies on
    # each cell owning its own stream (or NATS account); see the stream
    # provisioner. Do not share a stream across cells without a qualifier.
    #
    # Invalid input: subject_for still validates the group ID and raises
    # ArgumentError/TypeError on a malformed one (even though the ID no longer
    # determines the partition), rather than silently routing it. The publish
    # caller runs on an audited request path, so it must treat NATS routing as
    # best-effort: rescue the error, fall back to the Sidekiq streaming path,
    # and never let an instrumentation failure break the audited action.
